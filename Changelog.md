Initially I made the todo list app based on the [analog todo cards](https://ugmonk.com/blogs/journal/analog-the-simplest-productivity-system) design.
Using one card to represent Todo, Next, and Someday cards.
However I found that Next and Someday cards act differently and should be represented as different cards.
Todo cards are based on date
Where both Next and Someday cards are based on groupings like projects or goals or time frames like month or year.
These cards also need to be able to be archived and unarchived.
